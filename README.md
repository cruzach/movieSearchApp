# Project 2 - Movie Browser
This project is a movie browser. It will allow users to
search for movies included in the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
and view additional information (configured in the settings screen of the app) about any movies they select.
It uses React Native, so is meant for mobile use.

This is a project done while I took the Edx online course offered from Harvard- 'CS50M React Native and Mobile App Development'.
